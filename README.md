-This is a Windows style File Explorer I created using tkinter python.

-It displays files and folders windows style.

-It can rename files/folders.

-It can navigate through directories.

-The starting directory is where you open the app (The current working directory).

-The folders/files can be deleted.

-A new folder can be created.

-There is a text box where you can type in a path and click the change directory button to use the File Explorer in that directory.

-Once you change a directory by double clicking a folder, there appears a back button to navigate back.

-Here is how it looks:
